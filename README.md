# Macronutrient Composition Analysis of Wild Orangutan Feed Types
This repository presents a comprehensive R script for analyzing the macronutrient profiles (Protein, Fat, Neutral Detergent Fiber [NDF], and Total Non-Structural Carbohydrates [TNC]) of different food types and parts consumed by Sumatran orangutans (*Pongo abelii*) in their natural habitat.

## Background
Understanding the nutritional composition of natural feed items is essential to ecological and conservation studies, especially for species such as orangutans that rely heavily on seasonal and diverse plant sources.
This project focuses on:
- Comparing nutrient concentrations across feed types (e.g., ripe vs. unripe fruit, seeds, leaves, shoots).
- Identifying dominant macronutrients.
- Visualizing patterns using bar plots, heatmaps, and boxplots.
